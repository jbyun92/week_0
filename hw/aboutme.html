		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>There is not that much that you need to 	know about me. Basically, I used to look like 
			<img src = "file:///C:/Users/j/Desktop/HackYale/Week_0/images/before.jpg" alt = "Chubby" width = "200" height = "300"> 
		</p>
		<p>because I liked to eat a lot of things like
			<img src = "file:///C:/Users/j/Desktop/HackYale/Week_0/images/pretzels.jpg" alt = "pretzels" width = "300" height = "200">
		</p>
		<p> Luckily, I started to really like vegetables so now I look more like
			<img src="file:///C:/Users/j/Desktop/HackYale/Week_0/images/after.jpg" alt = "after" width = "200" height = "400">
		</p>
		<p>Minor improvement. If you want to check out my Github,
